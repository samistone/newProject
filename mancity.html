    <h1>MANCITY THE CHAMPIONS OF EUROPE</h1>
    <h2>Yes!!! We have brought it home once again, the sky is blue</h2>
    <p>Our dramatic 3-2 win over Aston Villa in the final game of the season sealed the title and saw us finish one point ahead of second-place Liverpool at the end of a gruelling battle for supremacy.It marks Pep Guardiolaâ€™s 11th major honour since becoming City manager in 2016.<p>After the full-time whistle at the Etihad, our fans were able to see Fernandinho, our captain and leader, lift the Premier League trophy in his last act as a City player before bringing an end to his nine-year stay at the Club.</p>
    <p>In our 38 league matches this season, we have won 29, drawn six and lost three, scoring 99 goals in the process.City have once again shown remarkable consistency this term, with our squad regularly rotated throughout the season and every player contributing significantly to this success.Our exceptional form this season continues a trend seen over the past five campaigns.</p>
    <p>In the 190 Premier League matches City have played during the last half decade, we have won 146, taken 458 points (at an average of 2.5 points per game) and scored a remarkable 485 goals (at an average of 2.5 goals per game). City have also conceded the fewest goals and boast the best goal difference during that period.It means City have won three Premier League titles for a second successive season, with our first-team triumph added to our Premier League 2 and Under-18s Premier League successes.And there will be a celebration parade in Manchester city centre on Monday evening.</p>
    <p>More information will follow right here this evening.Everyone at Manchester City would like to send their congratulations to Pep, his backroom staff and all the players on yet another remarkable achievement for the football club.</p>
